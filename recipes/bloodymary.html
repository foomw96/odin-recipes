    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The cocktail is named the Bloody Mary after Queen Mary Tudor of England, best known for her cruel and incredibly violent actions against Protestants in the 1500s. The vodka in the cocktail is meant to symbolize the Queen's fiery and wicked temper, while the red color of the tomato juice represents the bloodshed.</p>

    <p>Aside from the fact that vodka is not healthy in and of itself, a Bloody Mary is actually a relatively healthy cocktail. The drink's ingredients are packed full of electrolytes, potassium, sodium, and Vitamin C. Furthermore, tomatoes contain a compound called lycopene, which is high in antioxidants, helping to combat any toxins in the liver.</p>
