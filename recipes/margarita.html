    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Nobody really knows who invented the Margarita, but there are many stories about its origin and just as many people who claim to have invented it (more on that below). One of the oldest stories regarding the creation of the Margarita surrounds a customer’s allergy to most spirits, except for tequila. The bartender essentially turned a tequila shot into cocktail recipe, using these three essential ingredients: tequila, cointreau/triple sec, and lime.</p>

    <p>Since then, the Margarita has taken on a life of its own, becoming the iconic, canonical drink that it is today. It's served as a source of inspiration for bartenders, songwriters, good times, and debauchery alike. There are countless variations, ranging from spicy riffs to mezcal-driven spinoffs, but nothing hits quite like the original recipe.</p>

        <li>1 ¾ oz Blanco tequila</li>
        <li>1 oz Lime juice</li>
