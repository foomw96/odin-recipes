    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A combination of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth, the Negroni tastes bittersweet, with savory notes of herbs and spices. The gin used in the cocktail brings forward botanical notes that pair with the sweet cherry and citrus flavors of Campari, and sweet vermouth works to balance out any harsh bitterness from the other spirits.</p>

    <p>The Negroni gets its name from Count Camillo Negroni, who had developed a palate for strong liquor while working in the American Wild West as a rodeo clown. According to Italian folklore, while visiting a bar in the country, Count Negroni demanded a stronger version of the Americano cocktail — a combination of Campari, sweet vermouth, and club soda. The drink that was placed in front of him was a combination of gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth, which he later named the Negroni — after himself, of course.</p>
